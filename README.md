# 🍏 Jamf Pro Scripts & Solutions

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is my little toolbox of scripts and solutions designed for managing **iOS** and **macOS** devices with **Jamf Pro**.

Whether it's automating setup tasks, deploying apps, configuring system settings, or just making life easier for IT admins — you'll find a mix of practical tools here, all cooked up with care (and tested in the wild 🧪).

## 📁 What's in here?

A bit of everything, really:
- Scripts to streamline macOS configurations
- Automation for app installations and updates
- iOS device management tweaks
- Jamf Pro tricks and workarounds
- …and whatever else I come up with!

I created these tools to solve real-world problems — if they help you too, even better!
